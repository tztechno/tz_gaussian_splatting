### about dounut.html

3D Gaussian Splatting is a cutting-edge technology that is actually being used in animation production! The interactive example I created shows the basic concept of this technology, but it is used in a more advanced form in real-world animation production.

Real-world applications in animation:

4D Gaussian Splatting (including time axis)

4D Gaussian Splatting is a technology that adds a time axis to 3D Gaussian Splatting, allowing real-time dynamic scene rendering Gaussian splatting - Wikipedia +2. This allows:

High-quality real-time rendering of dynamic scenes

Accurate capture of human body movements and complex dynamic motion

Difference from conventional techniques
Unlike traditional techniques that rely on polygons or complex neural networks, 3D Gaussian Splatting uses millions of tiny semi-transparent ellipsoids called "Gaussian splats" to represent a scene. 3D Gaussian Splatting: A new frontier in rendering | Chaos.
Relationship to my work
The interactive donut visualization I created:

Implements the basic concepts of 3D Gaussian Splatting
Provides real-time manipulation capabilities
Designed as an educational demonstration

In actual animation production, a 4D version is used that incorporates more complex time-axis control, physical simulation, and advanced optimization. This technology is positioned as a key technology that will shape the future of the animation industry.
